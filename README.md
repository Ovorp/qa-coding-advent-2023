# qa-coding-advent-2023
A repo to have a collection of answers for the https://adventofcode.com/ challenge.  This is a place for us to put our answers and look at other solutions.

Create a PR to add your answer to this repo (one option is to create a branch, write your code and then create the PR, you might have to fork the repo or give me your email to add you as a collaborator.  Still figuring this out).  Create a folder with your name, and then you can add your files with your answer in that folder.  I would name the file with the day (i.e. day 1, day2).  If you have any questions on how to create PR, or are having any issues reach out to the slack channel or Nathan.

Add your name to the list below and the language you are using.
